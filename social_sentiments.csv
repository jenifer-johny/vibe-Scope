modify this pdf with more accurate text and sentiments which i give it before
Okay, I see the data you've provided.Just to clarify, the data you've shared is in a CSV format, not a PDF. I'll work with the CSV data.Regarding your request to "modify and change the sentiment and text column values to increase accuracy," I want to make sure we're on the same page. Model accuracy is a measure of how well a model performs after it has been trained on the data. I cannot directly edit the text or sentiment labels in the raw data in a way that guarantees increased accuracy without a specific understanding of what corrections or changes are needed based on the actual content and desired outcome. The sentiment labels you provide are what the model learns from.I can, however, provide the data you just shared in the CSV format you specified, with all six columns. This is the data you should use with the Python script for training.Here is the data you provided, formatted as a CSV:sentiment,id,date,query,user,text
